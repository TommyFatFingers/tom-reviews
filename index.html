    <h2>Review: Buying a home (as first time buyers)</h2>
    <img class="zoomable-image" src="/images/home.jpg" alt="pub">
    <p>About 8 years ago I went through a DRO or debt relief order which is basically a soft bankruptcy. <br>
        I had lost my job and owed nearly 20k.<br>
         I was fortunate to have a roof over my head living at a social co-operative (its a weird type of social housing that I should probably write a review for).<br>
    <br>
        Anyway - 8 years after reaching the bottom, my wife and I have managed to save enough for 5% deposit on a house under 200k. <br>
        We have had to move an hour away to be able to afford a place but I am amazed not to be renting. 

        The process of saving for a house basically meant we were semi-hermitted for 2 years. <br>
        finding a house within our budget and that fitted our hopes and dreams was quite difficult. <br>
        we were "gazumped" on 2 houses we had bids accepted for - this is where a cash buyer has stolen the sale from under us. <br>
        The house we bought we had intitally seen a few months prior but we didnt put an offer in as it was about 30K over what we wanted to pay.<br>
        The seller dropped the price just as we had about given up of finding anything and we managed to buy a recently built home (6years old) for 3k less then the seller paid for it!<br>

        then we basically just had to pay loads of people loads of money to do all the paperwork for us and it took around 3.5months! <br>
        It was pretty confusing and we made a few faux pas such as getting a better rate on mortgage after exchanging contracts - but it all worked out fine.<br>
        <br>

moving in and out was OK as we had loads of volunteers! <br>even my old neighbour helped me move out...cant tell if that means he liked us or wanted us out!<br>
we rented a luton van with a tail lift and managed to get 90% of the stuff on and the rest in peoples cars.<br>
we had everything in the new house just by just after midday! massive thanks to everyone that helped xxx <br>

the day we picked up the keys we decided to rug doctor the entire house as the carpest looked dirty. <br>
we did a good job. <br>
however msyelf and my mother in law got a good whiff of teh carpet the next day when we were putting the sofa together and our heads were near the floor: <br><br>
PISS. <br><br>
Piss all over the carpets. <br>
apparantly cleaning a carpet can agitate old smells. <br>
Once you smell it you cant get rid of it. we tried lots of cleaning products and white vinegar and such 
until it was decided we had no choice but to rip out the carpet and put in laminate wood flooring.<br>
This took us about 4 days to buy everything (with some help) and get it done.<br>
<br>

I am very happy with the results but fuck me it was some work and i was not expecting to be renovating a room after less than a few days of home ownership. <br><br>
Also the toilets are leaking and I have literally just discovered one of the upstairs windows wont shut. <br>

I imagine my weekends will forever be filled with trips to B&Q and odd jobs

        <h2>Review: Posh pub restuarant (food)</h2>
        <p>On day two of operation: spend all my money as fast as I can, we are going to posh pub/restaurant<br>
to anyone thinking "err no a pub cant be a posh restaurant" fuck off, they serve cocktails. <br>
Am I reviewing the meal? no. <br>
I am reviewing just having a meal at a venue. <br>
I walked to this pub (proper trek) once and just ordered a J20 and some chips and I was blown away.<br>
How the hell someone can make chips and blow me away must either point to my lack of a culinary palete or that this place is bloody amazing. <br>
Since the chips I have eaten at the 3 Horseshoes In madingley like 3 times (bloody expensive)<br>
but as we are moving away from the area soon I cannot think of a better last meal <br>
I will just get some random stuff off the menu. It will be great.<br>
<br>
actually I'm not writing a review of the meal cos when i get back home I just want to drink a beer and play Ps5 or watch something with my Wife.<br>
I am writing a review of something everyday, so I guess I am just getting this one out of the way<br>

        <h2>Review: Pay day takeaway (Indian)</h2>
        <p>Its pay day! Lets celebrate by spending my money as quickly as possible and buy an expensive takeaway!<br>
Thats £40 down the drain on vindaloo, naan, poppadoms, onion bhajis, whatever my wife had and a burning ring piece tomorrow<br>
Sometimes the vindaloo isnt that spicy and I proper love it.<br>
most of the time I cry and my nose runs.<br>

        <h2>Review: Next Goal Wins (Movie)</h2>
        <p>I only went and looked at my phone for most of the movie again.<br>
There was definitely a few laughs to be had and there probably would have been a few more if I had paid attention but it wasnt a particularly gripping movie. <br>
I usually love a sporting under dog story but this one just didnt grab me.<br> </p>

        <h2>Review: Buttering soft bread on a cold day (with cold butter)</h2>
        <p>Its 8am and I'm making sandwiches for my packed lunch. <br>
We've ran out of spreadable lurpack (I am nearly middleclass).<br>
Remembering all the Bear Grylls episodes I have ever watched, I overcome and adapt by just making a cheese and marmite sandwich;<br>
Marmite will have to act as the butter.<br>
My wife ominously calls down the stairs:<br>
"Can you make me a sandwich too?"<br>
I panick! <br>
"We've ran out of spreadable butter!" I shout upstairs<br>
"My dear Husband, We have some normal butter, use that." she shouts back while she applies her make up.<br>
I look at the solid ice white butter dish and gulp. <br>
Surely she cant be serious? Use the cold butter? This bread is difficult not to tear a hole in with spreadable butter. <br>
"Are you sure you want a sandwich? I dont think this is gonna work."<br>
I cant quite remember what my wife said, but I realised I never really had a choice. <br>
I had to make her a sandwich or deal with the consequences, for who knows how long.<br>
I implemented a fine slicing technique reminiscent of the ancient chinese torture method, Death by a thousand papercuts.<br>
While doing this I thought about microwaving the butter or pouring boiling water on the lid of the butter dish but then I looked down and I was pretty much done.<br>
Here are my results:<br>

        <h2>Review: Danny Brown - Y.B.P (Music Video)</h2>
        <p>My doctor recently called me middle aged on my last check up;<br>
I am also white and I'm about to be upgraded from working class to middle class.<br>
This makes it difficult for me to relate to the new Danny Brown song, Y.B.P, which I assume means "young, black & poor".<br>
this doesnt stop me somewhat enjoying the track and especially enjoying the final 3rd of stop motion video. <br>
the guy on the 2nd verse some some awkward sounding delivery which I would usually associate with Danny Brown - I dont know what this signifies.<br>

        <h2>Review: Trips to the Tip (recycling centre)</h2>
        <p> I kinda love a trip to the tip.<br>
I'm moving house so have lots of old crap to throw away.<br>
bang it all in the boot of the car.<br>
10 mins down the road, get to the tip.<br>
show off my reverse parking skills by parking in the diagonal bays.<br>
ask the bloke in the Hi-Vis "would you count this old hoover as plastic or metal?"<br>
His eyes light up with £ signs as he asks "is that a dyson?"<br>
"No mate, its some cheap shit from tesco."<br>
"chuck it in the metal bin" he nods towards the big metal skip and is pleased that his sage judgement has been heeded.<br>
then you get to climb the stairs to the massive skip and toss your crap in.<br>
<br>
Occasionally I have to get sneaky and hide a bag of rubbish around a corner or chuck it in a skip i'm 50% sure is the right category.<br>

        <h2>Review: Jack Reacher, Season 2 (Prime TV series)</h2>
        <p>Jack reacher season 2 wasn't as good as season 1.<br>
I did like meeting his old army buddies but it just meant there was less screen time for Reacher to break bones.<br>
Everyfight they did have, up until near the end, was always a knife fight because the bad guys didnt want to cause a scene.<br>
So many times the series could of just ended if someone decided to shoot a gun instead (is this even set in America?)<br>
Rather than link to a video from this current season, as I feel I have been bombarded by trailers for it, I have linked to a fight scene from season 1 
which shows some good ol' bone breaking action<br> </p>

        <h2>Review: The Kitchen (Netflix Movie)</h2>
        <p>The Kitchen is a drama set in a dystopian future that occasionally reminded me of Romain Gavras' movie "Athena."<br>
Where Athena focused on the figureheads of both the rebels and the police, the kitchen concentrates on one citizen (UK rapper Kano) of the slums and his attempt to get a one-bedroom flat!<br>
His plans go awry when he re-unites with his long-avoided son.<br>
It's as exciting as it sounds.<br>
While the movie looks nice and colourful, I just found myself looking at my phone instead and scrolling through Reddit.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to figure out why he even wanted a 1-bedroom flat anyway. He already had one and was probably paying fuck all rent<br>
Also Ian Wright Wright Wright is in the movie. </p><br>

        <h2>Review: Colgate - Max White (Toothpaste)</h2>
        <p> A favoured reader has requested I review my tootpaste...<br>
         I am beholdent to my readers.<br>
INTRODUCING: Colgate Max White with crystals (wooo) and 10x longer fresher breath. <br>
I dont really think much about brushing my teeth. It's a quick couple of minutes of my day that seem really inconsequential 
so writing a review means I currently have a good dollop of toothpaste sloshing about in my gob.<br>
Its not that minty! Its mostly chalky. It definitely has a kick of freshness about it which I will guess is atrributed to: (checking the ingredients list)...Methylcellulose(?)<br>
 That sounds minty. <br>
Is it whitening my teeth? Its got some grainy bits in it so there is propbably a small element of the toothpaste slowly sandpapering my teeth back to sparkly white; but they
largely remain a whitey yellowy colour. <br>
<br>
The reader has asked some rather personal questions:<br>
"DOES YOUR WIFE PUSH THE PASTE UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TUBE OR DOES SHE DO IT FROM THE TOP?"<br>
My wife is an intelligent lady so obviously from the bottom. She wouldnt be Mrs Tom-reviews if the opposite were true.<br>
Do I have any brand loyalty? I didnt think so! But my Wife reliably informs me that we are, in fact, a Colgate(tm) household. <br>
And that she was rather disappointed in me when I erroneously purchased some cheap Aquafresh.<br>
When I buy toothpaste I just buy whatever brand name is closest to £1. clearly I rarely buy the toothpaste.<br>
<br>
The reader goes on to ask for a "price to performance ratio" but I didnt buy it so I guess thats a 0:1 <br>
which means my teeth are clean and the joint account is probably lean as Wife is probably buying mega expensive toothpaste. <br>
<br>
overall the toothpaste doesnt have any "wow" factor so I would happily try a different one. dont expect a review.

        <h2>Review: Large bread rolls (6 pack from Tesco)!</h2>
        <p>I mean, what has this website come to already (day 4)? <br>
Have I already run out of things to review?<br>
I told my wife that I intended to review at least one thing a day and she helpfully suggested I review the breadrolls we ate last night.<br>
Ok then....I do love bread.<br>
These rolls are pretty large and easily fit a slice of those slices of cheese you can buy for like £4 for 2 packs at Tesco. <br>
I was suprised at how soft these particluar rolls were, perhaps we got lucky and picked the freshest pack off of the shelves. </p>
Texture: Like a fluffy cloud and no stodge to it<br>
Flavour: Bread<br>
Aroma: didnt really have one but if you got in there like a pig searching for truffles I am certain it would smell of bread.<br>
<br>
Overall we both enjoyed our beef burgers, cheese & onion, and my cheese & marmite rolls over the last 2 days. <br>
Beloved Wife can have the last roll.<br>

        <h2>Review: LASERS (Free steam game)</h2>
        <p> compete against other players in a race to the finish line while dodging lasers <br>
            The main draw of the game seems to be the jiggle mechanics on the boobs and making your character twerk.<br> 
            for a free game it doesn't compete with "fall guys" but it's a fun attempt with some challenging levels<br>
            I played it for a total of 0.4 hours (according to steam) and I might play it again after a beer.  <br>
