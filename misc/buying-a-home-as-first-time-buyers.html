    <h2>Review: Buying a home (as first time buyers)</h2>
    <img class="zoomable-image" src="/images/home.jpg" alt="pub">
    <p>About 8 years ago I went through a DRO or debt relief order which is basically a soft bankruptcy. <br>
        I had lost my job and owed nearly 20k.<br>
         I was fortunate to have a roof over my head living at a social co-operative (its a weird type of social housing that I should probably write a review for).<br>
    <br>
        Anyway - 8 years after reaching the bottom, my wife and I have managed to save enough for 5% deposit on a house under 200k. <br>
        We have had to move an hour away to be able to afford a place but I am amazed not to be renting. 

        The process of saving for a house basically meant we were semi-hermitted for 2 years. <br>
        finding a house within our budget and that fitted our hopes and dreams was quite difficult. <br>
        we were "gazumped" on 2 houses we had bids accepted for - this is where a cash buyer has stolen the sale from under us. <br>
        The house we bought we had intitally seen a few months prior but we didnt put an offer in as it was about 30K over what we wanted to pay.<br>
        The seller dropped the price just as we had about given up of finding anything and we managed to buy a recently built home (6years old) for 3k less then the seller paid for it!<br>

        then we basically just had to pay loads of people loads of money to do all the paperwork for us and it took around 3.5months! <br>
        It was pretty confusing and we made a few faux pas such as getting a better rate on mortgage after exchanging contracts - but it all worked out fine.<br>
        <br>

moving in and out was OK as we had loads of volunteers! <br>even my old neighbour helped me move out...cant tell if that means he liked us or wanted us out!<br>
we rented a luton van with a tail lift and managed to get 90% of the stuff on and the rest in peoples cars.<br>
we had everything in the new house just by just after midday! massive thanks to everyone that helped xxx <br>

the day we picked up the keys we decided to rug doctor the entire house as the carpest looked dirty. <br>
we did a good job. <br>
however msyelf and my mother in law got a good whiff of teh carpet the next day when we were putting the sofa together and our heads were near the floor: <br><br>
PISS. <br><br>
Piss all over the carpets. <br>
apparantly cleaning a carpet can agitate old smells. <br>
Once you smell it you cant get rid of it. we tried lots of cleaning products and white vinegar and such 
until it was decided we had no choice but to rip out the carpet and put in laminate wood flooring.<br>
This took us about 4 days to buy everything (with some help) and get it done.<br>
<br>

I am very happy with the results but fuck me it was some work and i was not expecting to be renovating a room after less than a few days of home ownership. <br><br>
Also the toilets are leaking and I have literally just discovered one of the upstairs windows wont shut. <br>

I imagine my weekends will forever be filled with trips to B&Q and odd jobs
