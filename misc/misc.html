        <h2>Review: Buttering soft bread on a cold day (with cold butter)</h2>
        <p>Its 8am and I'm making sandwiches for my packed lunch. <br>
We've ran out of spreadable lurpack (I am nearly middleclass).<br>
Remembering all the Bear Grylls episodes I have ever watched, I overcome and adapt by just making a cheese and marmite sandwich;<br>
Marmite will have to act as the butter.<br>
My wife ominously calls down the stairs:<br>
"Can you make me a sandwich too?"<br>
I panick! <br>
"We've ran out of spreadable butter!" I shout upstairs<br>
"My dear Husband, We have some normal butter, use that." she shouts back while she applies her make up.<br>
I look at the solid ice white butter dish and gulp. <br>
Surely she cant be serious? Use the cold butter? This bread is difficult not to tear a hole in with spreadable butter. <br>
"Are you sure you want a sandwich? I dont think this is gonna work."<br>
I cant quite remember what my wife said, but I realised I never really had a choice. <br>
I had to make her a sandwich or deal with the consequences, for who knows how long.<br>
I implemented a fine slicing technique reminiscent of the ancient chinese torture method, Death by a thousand papercuts.<br>
While doing this I thought about microwaving the butter or pouring boiling water on the lid of the butter dish but then I looked down and I was pretty much done.<br>
Here are my results:<br>

        <h2>Review: Trips to the Tip (recycling centre)</h2>
        <p> I kinda love a trip to the tip.<br>
I'm moving house so have lots of old crap to throw away.<br>
bang it all in the boot of the car.<br>
10 mins down the road, get to the tip.<br>
show off my reverse parking skills by parking in the diagonal bays.<br>
ask the bloke in the Hi-Vis "would you count this old hoover as plastic or metal?"<br>
His eyes light up with £ signs as he asks "is that a dyson?"<br>
"No mate, its some cheap shit from tesco."<br>
"chuck it in the metal bin" he nods towards the big metal skip and is pleased that his sage judgement has been heeded.<br>
then you get to climb the stairs to the massive skip and toss your crap in.<br>
<br>
Occasionally I have to get sneaky and hide a bag of rubbish around a corner or chuck it in a skip i'm 50% sure is the right category.<br>

        <h2>Review: Colgate - Max White (Toothpaste)</h2>
        <p> A favoured reader has requested I review my tootpaste...<br>
         I am beholdent to my readers.<br>
INTRODUCING: Colgate Max White with crystals (wooo) and 10x longer fresher breath. <br>
I dont really think much about brushing my teeth. It's a quick couple of minutes of my day that seem really inconsequential 
so writing a review means I currently have a good dollop of toothpaste sloshing about in my gob.<br>
Its not that minty! Its mostly chalky. It definitely has a kick of freshness about it which I will guess is atrributed to: (checking the ingredients list)...Methylcellulose(?)<br>
 That sounds minty. <br>
Is it whitening my teeth? Its got some grainy bits in it so there is propbably a small element of the toothpaste slowly sandpapering my teeth back to sparkly white; but they
largely remain a whitey yellowy colour. <br>
<br>
The reader has asked some rather personal questions:<br>
"DOES YOUR WIFE PUSH THE PASTE UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TUBE OR DOES SHE DO IT FROM THE TOP?"<br>
My wife is an intelligent lady so obviously from the bottom. She wouldnt be Mrs Tom-reviews if the opposite were true.<br>
Do I have any brand loyalty? I didnt think so! But my Wife reliably informs me that we are, in fact, a Colgate(tm) household. <br>
And that she was rather disappointed in me when I erroneously purchased some cheap Aquafresh.<br>
When I buy toothpaste I just buy whatever brand name is closest to £1. clearly I rarely buy the toothpaste.<br>
<br>
The reader goes on to ask for a "price to performance ratio" but I didnt buy it so I guess thats a 0:1 <br>
which means my teeth are clean and the joint account is probably lean as Wife is probably buying mega expensive toothpaste. <br>
<br>
overall the toothpaste doesnt have any "wow" factor so I would happily try a different one. dont expect a review.

        <h2>Review: Large bread rolls (6 pack from Tesco)!</h2>
        <p>I mean, what has this website come to already (day 4)? <br>
Have I already run out of things to review?<br>
I told my wife that I intended to review at least one thing a day and she helpfully suggested I review the breadrolls we ate last night.<br>
Ok then....I do love bread.<br>
These rolls are pretty large and easily fit a slice of those slices of cheese you can buy for like £4 for 2 packs at Tesco. <br>
I was suprised at how soft these particluar rolls were, perhaps we got lucky and picked the freshest pack off of the shelves. </p>
Texture: Like a fluffy cloud and no stodge to it<br>
Flavour: Bread<br>
Aroma: didnt really have one but if you got in there like a pig searching for truffles I am certain it would smell of bread.<br>
<br>
Overall we both enjoyed our beef burgers, cheese & onion, and my cheese & marmite rolls over the last 2 days. <br>
Beloved Wife can have the last roll.<br>
